## Schedule

### Session 01 - 01/24/17 - Installation / openFrameworks basics

This session will introduce you to openFrameworks, a creative-coding toolkit written primarily in C++.  It brings together many frameworks for a cross-platform coding environment capable of real-time audio visual analysis, graphics, sound processing, 3D, multithreading, communication protocols, and plenty more.  In this session, we'll see how to navigate openFrameworks, build a project, compile existing examples, and find additional resources.

### Session 02 - 01/31/17 - Basic Graphics / Audio Recording

In the next two sessions, we'll explore the use of some basic graphics primitives, how to animate them, and use them to control the recording and playback of audio.  The end result will be multisampler that can record/playback audio, automatically segment audio, and we'll try and apply some simple filters.  Along the way we'll learn about a lot of basic coding principles including if statements, for loops, and how to use classes to build objects and abstract our code.  We'll also see how to use parameters to define elements in a graphical user interface.  By the end of today, we'll see how to create an audio recorder that can record audio and play it back, and next week we'll see how to add more interactivity including automatically segmenting audio and controlling the way it sounds with filtering.

### Session 03 - 02/07/17 - Audio Interaction

We'll continue with developing a multisampler that can record and playback audio.  The approach we take to develop our mutlisampler will allow us to scale it artibrarily, as well as add new functionality to it fairly easily.  We'll then explore another application which can chop audio automatically and we'll see how this can be used to create an infinitely generating random drum track.  To do this, we'll first see how to use the RMS of an audio signal to automatically segment audio.  Then we'll use some basic statistics of the RMS to segment audio and create some randomized audio playback of audio "grains", and also see how to visualize them.
