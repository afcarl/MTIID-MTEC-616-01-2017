 *
 *  This code is a very simple interface for Accelerate's fft/ifft code.
 *  It was built out of hacking Maximilian (Mick Grierson and Chris Kiefer) and
 *  the above mentioned resources for performing a windowed FFT which could
 *  be used underneath of an STFT implementation
 *
 *  Usage:
 *
 *  // be sure to either use malloc or __attribute__ ((aligned (16))
 *  float *sample_data = (float *) malloc (sizeof(float) * 4096);
 *  float *allocated_magnitude_buffer =  (float *) malloc (sizeof(float) *
 2048);
 *  float *allocated_phase_buffer =  (float *) malloc (sizeof(float) * 2048);
 *
 *  pkmFFT *fft;
 *  fft = new pkmFFT(4096);
 *  fft.forward(0, sample_data, allocated_magnitude_buffer,
 allocated_phase_buffer);
 *  fft.inverse(0, sample_data, allocated_magnitude_buffer,
 allocated_phase_buffer);
 *  delete fft;
